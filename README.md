# School_District_Analysis


# Overview of the school district analysis: 

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to fix the school district analysis in the wake of academic dishonesty while still conducting our analysis through the metrics of: school budget, per student capita, average math and reading scores, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage for students. 9th graders from Thomas High School have reportedly been submitting inaccurate grades, therefore these need to be discounted with NAs. Once these grades are replaced, we can carry on with the analysis. 

# District Summary

## How is the district summary affected by changes to the data?
Almost all of the changes in the district summary were very small, less than 1% of a full percentage. 

Data prior to changes:

Data after changes:

- school budget:
The school budget did not change by any discernable amount
- per student capita:
Per student capita also did not change
- average math scores:
Average math scores had less than a 1% difference usually
- average reading scores:
Average reading scores also had less than 1% difference usually
- passing percent for math:
Passing percentage for math was also neglegible. 
- passing percent for reading:
Any change here was also neglegible. 
- passing percentage for students:
Overall passing percentage was neglegible. 


# School Summary Analysis

## How is the school summary affected?

The school summaries were more affected by the changes in data. Thomas High School originally had an overall passing rate of around 91%, which was adjusted down to 65% after all the 9th grade students were removed from the set. 

Here is the prior ranking of Thomas High School at 91%:

Below is the readjusted Thomas High School ranking of 65%:

Math, reading and overall passing scores differed between the data sets, albiet not by much (a few decimals). The other scores did not differ, surprisingly. 


## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Replacing the ninth graders' scores brings the averages of Thomas High School's math and reading scores down slightly, by an almost discernable amount. 


## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade: scores from 9th graders have been nullified, the rest featuring little or no changes. 
  - Scores by school spending: School spending fell barely- any changes would be recognized past the tenths place
- Scores by school size: changes were barely visible
- Scores by school type: While charter schools generally performed a few points higher than district schools, changes outside of Thomas High School were neglegible

Below are updated math and reading scores per grade per school. Thomas High School's 9th grade class has been nullified in both.
